## About us

Currently I am a sole fullstack software developer and spend my time developing different software projects. My goal is to develop mainly projects and applications that provide added value during everyday work. This can be for other software developers as well as special industry solutions. My heart lies especially in the topic of "simplicity" and "time saving", because in my experience there are topics that are repeated over and over again. Therefore I don't necessarily want to develop something new, I want to develop software for the end user.
